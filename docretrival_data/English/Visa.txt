PROCEDURES TO TRANSFER VISITOR TO RESIDENT VISA
________________


SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU ARE HOLDING RESIDENT VISA OR ARC.
* With the exception of ARC with the purpose of residence of (a) employment or (b) study at a Chinese language center.
* While it is optional for employment ARC holders, it is compulsory for CLC’s ARC holders to transfer their ARC at BOCA just like the visitor visa holders.


PRESENT YOURSELF TO BOCA
* Students who are holding visitor visas need to present themselves to the Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA) for visa transfer application 8 working days before the duration of stay expires. 
* Speaking from experience, students should be extra aware of the preparation of (a) authenticated diplomas and (b) a health examination within 3 months as most students who failed the transfer application were due to the lack of these documents.
* The nearest BOCA office from NCKU is at Kaohsiung. The address is 3F-4F., No.6, Cheng Nan Rd., Lingya Dist., Kaohsiung City, Taiwan (R.O.C.) or in Chinese 高雄市苓雅區政南街6號3-4樓.
* For a full list of requirements, please refer to BOCA.
* Feel free to contact BOCA’s Kaohsiung at Tel. +886-7-7156600 or email bocakhh@boca.gov.tw.

KEY THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT ARC
* An Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) is an ID card to prove foreigners’ residency status in Taiwan. In most cases, a new admitted degree-seeking overseas student should aim to obtain ARC. Failure to do so generally means there are certain problems with his/her legal stay requirements and should notify OSSS immediately.
* Given you have finally obtained your ARC, there is certain information on the ID card you should note about.
* Date of expiry - Please remember to extend before it expires. Any expiration will result in fine and possibly repatriation.
* Date of issue - For students who first obtained the ARC, this is the day that starts counting on your eligibility for National Health Insurance (NHI). For further information on NHI, please refer to the chapter of insurance.
* Purpose of residence - In most cases, it should be 就學-國立成功大學 meaning study at NCKU. Other exceptions such as 依親 (dependent) and 應聘 (employment) are acceptable to enroll but certain rights are possibly affected such as ineligible to be registered to NHI under NCKU or scholarship revocation.
