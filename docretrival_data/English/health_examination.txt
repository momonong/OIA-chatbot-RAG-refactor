5. **Important Reminder for Freshman Physical Examination**:

6. **Cancellation of HIV Screening**:
   The Government of the Republic of China has amended regulations to cancel entry, stay, and residence restrictions for non-nationals infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Therefore, this health examination item is also canceled. As the government does not provide subsidies for non-nationals to treat HIV infection in Taiwan (annual treatment costs approximately NT$300,000 or about USD$10,000), it is recommended that non-nationals undergo HIV screening in their home country to understand their own health status. If infected, it is advised to stay in the home country for treatment. After entering Taiwan, non-nationals can undergo HIV screening at a hospital to understand their infection status.
